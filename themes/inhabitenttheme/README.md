project 4 in RED Academy was the most challenge so far. We worked for two week to build this custom theme site.

##About the Inhabitent Suply Co. Site

This site is for a company that sells traveling products online. this site is a custom site which means the company can change the products, the prices, the about page content, and the journal posts too, without going back to the developer.

###Technology Used
- WordPress
  * Use of Template Hierarchy
  * Custom Post Types
  * Custom Taxonomy Types
  * Using Template Parts
  * Plugin Building (custom shop hours plugin)
- Php (in the WP realm)
- HTML5
- SASS
- GULP Build Tool
- jQuery (WordPress built-in jQuery)
- GIT for version control.

### More on the Inhabitent theme
We start out theme with the underscore theme starter. we start with building a custom post type for the product that will be sold using the website. we build 4 main pages in this theme. first page is the front page that has a hero image , adventure articles and shopping link categories. another page for the blog posts with several ranked articles. a custom about page, the user can change the hero image and the content of the page. the forth page is for shopping through the whole products.
## Challenges
It was really challenge to work with Wordpress. but through this project I learn how important it is to make out websites more dynamic, the user can change and update freely. The famous loop in wordpress was something I really found helpful. through it we only design one post or one comment and the all the design will apply to all the page.
